# Tools-for-Analytics-Call-Analysis-Project

In this project, our purposes are twofold: first, analyze the top 10 causes of calls to 311 in our chosen ZIP code; second, analyze whether illegal parking incidents are a larger fraction of total 311 incidents in our ZIP code than they are in general. The dataset we utilized contains about 2.6 million calls to the 311 phone number for non-emergency services in New York City. This repository has two ipynb files that include our codes and analyses. Our zip code is 11101.
